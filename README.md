# pvtheory
Peculiar Velocity Theory Project

To make things easy, use Anaconda Python, create an isolated environment for this project, and use the requirements.txt file in the repository.  If Pylians fails, it might have to be installed separately following the instructions here: https://pylians3.readthedocs.io/en/master/installation.html

```
conda create -n pv python=3.11
conda activate pv
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
